This Manual and labs are a comprehensive introduction to Verilog Hardware Description Language (HDL), designed for both beginners and experienced engineers looking to deepen their understanding of digital system design. Whether you're new to Verilog or aiming to strengthen your skills, this course offers a solid foundation in modeling, simulating, and synthesizing digital logic. You’ll learn how to describe complex hardware systems using Verilog, with hands-on experience targeting both FPGA and ASIC platforms.   

Through progressive modules, real-world labs, and capstone projects, you'll gain practical skills applicable to embedded systems, electronics engineering, and chip design industries. This course balances conceptual understanding with industry-relevant application, making it ideal for students, hobbyists, and professionals alike.  

This Verilog Manual will walk you through a set of Labs and Exercises that will quickly let you see the results of your Verilog code implemented in hardware.  You will learn through hands-on-labs that will take you from simple Verilog syntax to more complex structures. The Lessons will explain the code, and the Labs will provide challenges implementing the concepts from the Lessons. This Tutorial will not go very deep into Simulation or Testbenches.  The goal is to teach basic Verilog syntax, and quickly see its implementation in the kit Hardware.  

While the Verilog design flows described in this Manual can target multiple FPGAs boards & ASIC tools flows, most design flows described in this manual,  will target the Gowin Sipeed Tang Nano 9K FPGA Development Board (GOWIN GW1NR-9)  


## Introduction - Verilog Hackathon Education Kit

**Verilog** is a hardware description language (HDL) used to describe and model digital systems. Instead of drawing schematics, engineers can write Verilog code to define how circuits behave and how they’re built. It is useful when designing systems like processors, memory controllers, or digital signal processing blocks. You can design, build, and parameterize a hardware description of something built from digital logic.

### Design Abstraction Levels in Verilog
One of Verilog’s strengths is that it lets you describe hardware at different levels of detail, depending on where you are in the design process. The three most common levels are:
* **Behavioral Level** – Describes what the system should do, using high-level control structures like if, case, and always. Verilog is an abstraction of the described logic, which can be parameterized, so make code portable and flexible.

  At this level, the designer focuses on what the system should do rather than how it will be built. The description is written using code that looks more like a sequence of instructions—these describe behavior over time, usually inside always blocks or with the help of functions and tasks. Think of this like writing a recipe without worrying about the kitchen layout. The actual structure of the hardware isn’t considered here—only the operations and flow.
* **Register-Transfer Level (RTL)** – Focuses on how data moves between registers and what operations are performed on that data. Most Verilog RTL descriptions are clocked by a system clock. This RTL is the most widely used level for synthesis (turning your design into hardware).

  This is the level where most real hardware designs are written. It deals with how data moves between registers and what logical or arithmetic operations are performed in between. It’s all synchronized to a clock. RTL is “synthesizable,” which means you can use it to generate real hardware. In modern terms, if a block of Verilog code can be turned into a circuit by a synthesis tool, it qualifies as RTL.
* **Gate level** – This is the lowest level, where you describe the circuit in terms of individual logic gates and their connections. You usually don’t write this by hand—it’s often generated by synthesis tools.

  Here, the design is broken down into individual logic gates—ANDs, ORs, NOTs, etc.—and the way they are connected. Signals are treated as having fixed logical values (0, 1, X for unknown, and Z for high-impedance). Gate-level code isn’t usually written by hand. It’s typically produced by synthesis tools, which convert RTL code into a detailed gate-level representation (called a netlist). This version is useful for simulations that need to consider exact timing, but it's not practical for initial design work.

Verilog is widely used because it scales well with complexity. It's much easier to manage a large project in Verilog than with a schematic. Designs written in Verilog are portable. They don’t depend on a specific chip or manufacturing process, which makes it easier to reuse and adapt them to FPGA or ASIC design flows.    

Verilog gives hardware engineers a way to write and test their designs using code. This approach makes debugging, simulation, and development faster and more flexible.  This is important for modern parameterized digital systems that would be impractical to handle graphically with Schematics.  

### ASIC vs FPGA: What’s the Difference?

> [!NOTE]🚧- ❎ Max is working on this

ASIC chip is manufactured from library elements (that is a list of
very basic logic primitives like INV, AND, OR, different types of flip-flops
that could be used). Types, quantities, placement and connections between the
elements are design specific.

On the other hand, FPGA chip is manufactured with reconfigurable logic
elements, and the Verilog design is mapped on pre-existing logic and then
connected accordingly. Instead of making combinational logic out of certain
primitives, FPGA utilizes LUTs (lookup tables) that allow configuring generic
table into any logic function.

So on FPGA you are limited with existing number of LUTs, memories, and other
utility blocks like multipliers, while for ASIC you can use any number of
library elements as long as you have an area on the die to fit them.

FPGA is a great platform for prototyping, because you can easily
reconfigure the chip after making changes in Verilog source code. Meanwhile
ASIC is a huge commitment, because after sending the final design to the
factory you have to wait for several months before the first batch of chips
would be made. And if there would be a fault in the design, a fix would cost 
a lot of additional time and money.

The same Verilog design would be able to reach much higher clock frequency in
ASIC than on FPGA, due to length of FPGA interconnect fabric, LUT delay and
fixed placement of elements affecting timing.

### Verilog Design Flow Overview

> [!NOTE]🚧- ❎ Max is working on this

![OpenROAD layout result](images/openroad_layout.png)

On a high level, typical design flow has these stages:

* **RTL design** - Writing Verilog code
* **Verification** - Running Verilog code in simulation with a test program,
that checks the output of RTL against software model
* **Synthesis** - Converting Verilog description into a gate-level netlist of
primitives for target architecture. Netlist specifies elements and connections
between them, they are not physically placed yet.
* **Place and Route** - Assigning elements a place on the chip, then routing
them together

* [ASIC specific] **GDSII** - Final topology file is created that is sent to the
factory
* [FPGA specific] **Bitstream generation** - Generate bitstream and upload to
the board

The following are the Labs that are found in the [Basic Music - Hackation](https://github.com/verilog-meetup/basics-graphics-music) in the [Problems](https://github.com/verilog-meetup/basics-graphics-music/tree/main/hackathon/problems) directory.  Make sure you follow the instructions to git clone and copy these design files.

### Logical Gates
#### Logical Gates Introduction
In this first set of Verilog Labs, you are going to learn about Verilog **Logic Gates**.  

**Logic gates** are the building blocks of digital circuits. They process binary input values (0 or 1) and produce binary outputs based on specific logical rules. You use logic gates to build everything from simple decision-making circuits to complex CPUs and FPGAs.
* Learn how to create simple logic gates using Verilog.
* Use wire and assign statements to build AND, OR, XOR, NAND, NOR, and XNOR gates.
* Control onboard LEDs using push button inputs to visualize the gate behavior.

In the following labs you will explore the Verilog syntax and coding structures to build Logic Gates

#### Logic Gates Verilog Code
Logic gates form the foundation of all digital electronics. These basic building blocks process two or more binary input values/signals (0 and 1) and produce a single binary output based on logical rules. Gates like AND, OR, and XOR enable a wide range of operations.   

They can be simple LED control to complex logic. In Verilog, logic gates are implemented using continuous assignments (assign) and basic bitwise operators such as &, |, and ^. The following labs will introduce you to the Verilog syntax used to model and test these gates using Verilog on an FPGA platform, preparing you to build decision making circuits.  

This set of labs will introduce and let you build Verilog code to implement six fundamental logic gates. You will have an opportunity to build AND, OR, XOR, NAND,  NOR, and XNOR Verilog implementations, connecting Push Button switches to LED's.   

Each gate processes two binary inputs (0 = LOW, 1 = HIGH) and produces a binary output based on a specific logical rule. Let's take a look at the Logic Gate logical rules:
##### AND 
An **AND** gate outputs 1 only if both inputs are 1. This gate is used when multiple conditions must be true to activate a signal. An example would be requiring two buttons to be pressed simultaneously.  
**Logical Rules**  
| Gate     | Symbol | Description                                 | Output Rule |  
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------- | ----------- |   
| **AND**  | `&`    | Output is `1` only if **both inputs are 1** | a & b       |

**Verilog Example**  
```Verilog
assign led[0] = key[0] & key[1];
```
**Logic Diagram**  
<pre>   key[0] ----\ 
               AND ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----/ </pre>

**Truth Table**  
| Input[1] | Input[0] | Output (AND) |
| ------- | ------- | ------------ |
| 0       | 0       | 0            |
| 0       | 1       | 0            |
| 1       | 0       | 0            |
| 1       | 1       | 1            |  

##### OR 
An **OR** gate outputs 1 if at least one input is 1. It’s used when any of several inputs can activate a result.  An example would let an output LED turn on if either button A or button B were pressed.  Only one of the inputs needs to be active to create a logical result of a 1 on the output.  

**Logical Rules**  
| Gate     | Symbol | Description                                | Output Rule |  
| -------- | ------ | ------------------------------------------ | ----------- |   
| **OR**  | \|    | Output is `1` if **at least one input is 1** | a \| b      |

**Verilog Example**  
```Verilog
assign led[1] = key[0] | key[1];  
```
**Logic Diagram**  
<pre> key[0] ----\ 
             OR ---> led[0] 
 key[1] ----/ </pre>

**Truth Table**  
| Input[1] | Input[0] | Output (OR)  |
| -------- | -------- | ------------ |
| 0        | 0        | 0            |
| 0        | 1        | 1            |
| 1        | 0        | 1            |
| 1        | 1        | 1            |  

> [!NOTE] I'll add the XOR, NOR,NAND, XNOR later

#### Logic Gates Verilog Code Introduction

If you followed the GITHub clone instructions, you should have the following directory path:  
**~/gowin/basics-graphics-music/hackathon/problems/1_gates_and_muxes/** where you will find the file **hackathon_top.sv**  
```
cd gowin/basics-graphics-music/hackathon/problems/1_gates_and_muxes
```
Open the **hackathon_top.sv** in a code editor,  VS-Code is recommended, but any text editor will work.  

Let's review the Verilog syntax in this top level Verilog File. At this point, don't edit this file.  You are just looking at it.

---
**Comment Used To Control The FPGA Bash flow**

These 2 comments in Verilog are used by the Bash scripts that generate the FPGA files.  Please don't edit these comments.  
```
// Board configuration: tang_nano_9k_lcd_480_272_tm1638_hackathon
// This module uses few parameterization and relaxed typing rules
```

**Top Verilog Block Inputs and Outputs**  
This section of the Verilog file defines all the Inputs and Outputs of the top level block.  Think of these as physical pins coming into or out of your Top Level Verilog Block.  

```Verilog
module hackathon_top
(
    // System Clocks & Controls  
    input  logic       clock,
    input  logic       slow_clock,
    input  logic       reset,

    // HW-154 I/O Board - Switches & LEDs  
    input  logic [7:0] key,
    output logic [7:0] led,

    // A dynamic seven-segment display  
    output logic [7:0] abcdefgh,
    output logic [7:0] digit,

    // LCD screen interface  
    input  logic [8:0] x,
    input  logic [8:0] y,
    output logic [4:0] red,
    output logic [5:0] green,
    output logic [4:0] blue,

    // HW-154 I/O Board Communication Channel  
    inout  logic [3:0] gpio
);
```
We are going to only look at the HW-154 I/O Board - Switches & LEDs section
```Verilog
    // HW-154 I/O Board - Switches & LEDs  
    input  logic [7:0] key,
    output logic [7:0] led,
```
**inout** defines the direction of the signal pin, **logic** defines the type of "wire", \[7:0\] defines how many signals are generated in this "bus", and **key** is the name of the signals.

**output** defines the direction of the signal pin, **logic** defines the type of "wire", \[7:0\] defines how many signals are generated in this "bus", and **led** is the name of the signals.

When this code is synthesized, it will generate the following pins/wires you can connect to:  
key[0]  
key[1]  
key[2]  
key[3]   
key[4]  
key[5]  
key[6]  
key[7]  

led[0]  
led[1]  
led[2]  
led[3]  
led[4]  
led[5]   
led[6]   
led[7]     

For this Logic Gates Lab, you are only going ot be using the **input  logic [7:0] key,** and **output logic [7:0] led,**. The other inout/outpus, input logic clock, input logic slow_clock, input logic reset, the dynamic seven-segment display & the LCD screen interface wires will be used and explained in subsequent labs.  

While we actually pass signals between the Gowin FPGA board and the HW-154 GPIO board using a serial bus, that actually uses the inout  **logic [3:0] gpio** bus, for these first Logic and Mux labs, you can imagine the following block diagram representation.

#### 🛠️ LAB Activity #1: Run Un-Edited Code

**Gate, Wire, and Continuous Assignments**  
Let's see how to connect and generate an **AND** gate. In the assign statement below, we are connecting the inputs key[0] and key[1] to the led[0].  the **&** that you see in the right hand side of the assignment **=** sign is telling this assign statement to perform a Bitwise AND operation between key[0] and key[1].

Only when both buttons **key[0]** and **key[1]** are pressed (value 1), **led[0]** will be turned ON (1).

**assign** is a continuous assignment, which creates combinational logic—the output updates automatically and immediately when inputs change.

This will look like the following schematic diagram:
**Logic Diagram**  
<pre>   key[0] ----\ 
               AND ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----/ </pre>
   
```Verilog
    // Gates, wires and continuous assignments

    assign led [0] = key [0] & key [1];
```
**Running the FPGA Bash scripts**
* If you have not done so already, Open a console window
* cd to the ~/gowin/basics-graphics-music/hackathon/problems/1_gates_and_muxes directory
```Bash
cd gowin/basics-graphics-music/hackathon/problems/1_gates_and_muxes
```
* with out saving any edits to hackathon_top.sv run the **03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash** script
```Bash
./03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash
```

**What Success Looks Like** - Only when both buttons **key[0]** and **key[1]** are pressed (value 1), **led[0]** will be turned ON (1)

#### 🛠️ LAB Activity #2: Change AND to OR  

**Challenge:** Change the code **assign led [0] = key [0] & key [1];** to preform an **OR** assignment 

**Hint**: \| is the bitwise OR operator. When you replace the & bitwise operator with \| the the result assigned to the led[0] is true (1) if either key[0] or key[1] is pressed. 
<pre>   key[0] ----\ 
               OR ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----/ </pre>

Edit your code, save it, 

**Running the FPGA Bash scripts**
* Save any edits to hackathon_top.sv, then in your console, run the bash **03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash** script
```Bash
./03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash
```
**Success?** When you press the key[0] the led[0] should now light up.  if you then only press key[1], the led[0] should also still light up.  If you press both key[0] and key[1], led[0] should also light up, because this is a bitwise **OR** will respond to either key[0], key[1] or both.

#### 🛠️ LAB Activity #3: Wire assignments - Aliasing signals  

**What is a Verilog "wire"?**  

In Verilog, a **wire** is one of the most fundamental data types used to model physical electrical connections. A wire represents a combinational signal. A wire is something that is driven by some other logic but does not store a value on its own.  
- Think of it like a copper wire on a breadboard. It connects components together.
- It simply carries signals from one point to another.
- It has no "memory". Wires are not like a register or variable that stores state. (You will learn about these later)

**Why and how should you use a "wire"**   
 - Connecting inputs to internal logic.
 - Connecting outputs of logic gates to module outputs.
 - Breaking up complex expressions into smaller parts.
 - Improving readability with aliases.

**Example Verilog Code With Wire Assignments**
```Verilog
  wire a = key[0];
  wire b = key[1];
  assign led[0] = a & b;
```
- wire a = key[0]; means: connect the wire a to the bit key[0].
- 'a' now acts exactly like key[0], it's just a more readable or convenient name.
- Then, you can write logic expressions using a and b like variables, but they are just "wires."

Take a look at these diagrams and make sure you understand that they are equvelent:
<pre>   key[0] ----\ 
               AND ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----/ 

   key[0] ----> a ----\ 
                       AND ---> led[0] 
   key[1] ----> b ----/</pre>
</pre>

**Challenge:** Use a wire assignment to create an **XOR** gate
* Create some "wires".  Assign key[0] to a wire lable "a", and key[1] to a wire lable "b"
* Update the Logical Gate oporator to the **XOR** operation using the "^" charactor. 

```Verilog
    wire a = key [0];  // Note a new construct - wire
    wire b = key [1];

    assign led [1] = a ^ b; // XOR - eXclusive OR
```
**Running the FPGA Bash scripts**
* Save any edits to hackathon_top.sv, then in your console, run the bash **03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash** script
```Bash
./03_synthesize_for_fpga.bash
```
**Success?** When you press the key[0] or the key[1] the led[0] should now light up.  This Logical Operation is exclusive, which means that the Logic will be asserted high only when either key[0] or key[1] is pressed, which will turn on the led[1]. If you press both key[0] and key[1], led[0] should not light up.  the same as if you did not push any keys.  This is an example of an exculusive operation, **XOR** when the inputs need to be differend.  It's one or the other input is asserted, but not both inputs.

### Multiplexers, Making Logical Choices
#### Multiplexers Introduction
In this set of Verilog Labs, you are going to learn about Verilog **Multiplexers** (Mux).  

A **Multiplexer** (MUX) is a digital switch that selects one of several input signals and forwards it to a single output, based on control (select) signals.  

You can think of a MUX as a digital switch or traffic controller:
* If the select line is 0, the output follows input 0
* If the select line is 1, the output follows input 1

This makes a MUX useful for choosing between signals, such as:
* Selecting between two or more signals
* Selecting between two sensors
* Switching between operating modes
* Routing data in processors

**2-to-1 MUX: How It Works**
A 2-to-1 MUX has:
* 2 data inputs: in0 and in1
* 1 select input: sel
* 1 output: out

**2-to-1 MUX: Truth Table**
when you look at this truth table, notice that when the sel is low, it will alow the input signal in0 to be propogated to the out signal.  When the sel signal is low or "0", it does not mater or care wha the in1 signal is. Only the in0 signal is propogated.  When sel is high or "1", then the in0 is ingnored, and the in1 signal is propogated.

| `sel` | `in1` | `in0` | `out` |
| ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 0     | X     | 0     | 0     |
| 0     | X     | 1     | 1     |
| 1     | 0     | X     | 0     |
| 1     | 1     | X     | 1     |

<pre>               ┌────────────┐
    in0 ─────▶│            │
               │            │
               │   2-to-1   │─────▶ out
    in1 ─────▶│    MUX     │
               │            │
    sel ─────▶│  select=sel│
               └────────────┘
</pre>

In the following labs you will explore the Verilog syntax and coding structures to build Logic Multiplexer (Mux's)
* Build a 2-to-1 MUX using assign out = sel ? in1 : in0;
* Observe how changing the select signal affects the output LED
* Learn how to extend MUX structures to support more inputs or wider data

        0: led [5] = d0;

            led [7] = d1;
        else
            led [7] = d0;

    always_comb
        case (sel)
        1: led [5] = d1;
        0: led [5] = d0;

    */

    //------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // The construct "{ , }" is called "concatenation"

    wire [1:0] d = { d1, d0 };
    assign led [4] = d [sel];

    // If sel == 0, we choose d [0] which is equal to d0
    // If sel == 1, we choose d [1] which is equal to d1

    //------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Exercise: Implement mux
    // without using "?" operation, "if", "case" or a bit selection.
    // Use only operations "&", "|", "~" and parenthesis, "(" and ")".

    //------------------------------------------------------------------------

    // Exercise: Implement a mux that chooses between four inputs
    // using two-bit selector.
